PLEASE NOTE I've imported this repository to GitHub because I still receive
requests related to it. I do not intend to further maintain it actively. If
you are interested in working on the code I will happily give you full access
to the repository, just drop me a note (svenfuchs@artweb-design.de or send me
a GitHub message). I also might help you out with advise or pointers but I
sadly can not invest tons of time into it.

h1. WillPaginate Liquidized

This plugin allows you to use will\_paginate with Liquid templates. That's it.

Note that for this is *not* compatible with any current version of will\_paginate but *only* with the (fairly old) version that was shipped with Mephisto when I wrote the mephisto\_paged\_article\_list plugin.
